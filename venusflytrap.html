<p>The Venus flytrap one of the most well known and unique carnivorous plant. </p>
<header><h2>They don't waste energy on non-food</h2></header>
<p> Venus fly traps do not want to close there mouths on false alarms because it would waste their energy, and they may lose their chance to catch actual prey. The way they do this is by the little hairs on the outside of their mouths. These are reactors and only when they are at least 2 hairs stimulated back to back they will they close so things like rain won't affect them</p>
<header><h2>They are native to the United States</h2></header>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. These carnivorous demon plants are native to the United States, specifically in North and South Carolina.</p>
<header><h2> They are almost extinct</h2></header>
<p> Venus fly traps are being lost in large numbers every year due to habitat loss. This has caused the United States government to put them under strict laws in order to preserve their existence.</p>
