<p> We can&#39;t include a list about flowers and not start with one of the most iconic flowers of all time, the crimson red flower of love, the rose. <p>
<header><h2>Roses are pretty healthy</h2></header>
<p> Three facts about the rose that you probably didn&#39;t know is that first you can eat wild roses(although you should probably rinse them off before consuming). That&#39;s right, roses are packed with plenty of essential vitamins such as fatty acids and vitamin C. </p>
<header><h2>The color effects the meaning</h2></header>
<p> Different rose colors represent different feelings. Starting with the most common color red represents love but what about other color roses? Orange roses represent energy and desire while yellow roses represent friendship and joy. White roses represent eternal love that is why they are often seen at funerals and weddings, weird coincidence right?</p>
<header><h2>United States National Flower</h2></header>
<p> Did you know that the rose is actually the national flower of the United States. In 1895 the idea that the United States needed a national flower arose and by popular demand the following year president Ronald Reagan signed that the red rose would be the official flower for the United States.</p>
