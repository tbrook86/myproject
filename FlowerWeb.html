<p>Flower plants are a type of vascular plant that produces flowers in order to reproduce. Well what causes these flowers to bloom? Well Flowering plants produce a protein known as flowering locus T in their leaves that provides the plant with the energy to start flowering. Once this protein is made, it travels from the leaves to the shoot apex, a part of the plant where cells are undifferentiated, think stem cells in a way. What this means is that the cells can now either become leaves or flowers.
